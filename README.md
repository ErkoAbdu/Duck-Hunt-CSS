# Duck-Hunt-CSS
The first version of duck hunt created in CSS and Javascript

## About The Project
Duck hunt is a game many are familiar with, and if not its simple! As the duck flies onto the screen you hunt it! I thought this would be a fun project to do as it brings so much nostalgia but also because its something that would be fun to create using sprite sheets and keyframe animations. This project was created as my submission for an assignment in the web development program at Humber College. 

## How To Use
To use just clone the repo and click the play button. You will have 60 seconds to hunt as many ducks as possible. When a duck flies onto the screen simply click it and your score will increase!

## Whats Next?
Using CSS I would love to also add the ducks death animation where once clicked it will stop its path and fall straight downards to the grass. After this I would also like to include the animation where the dog picks up the duck and even another where he laughs when you miss a shot. For the Javascript aspect I believe somehow creating a scoreboard at the end of the game would be an excellent idea!
